Project Summary – Hotel Management System

Project Title:
Hotel Management System – Backend with EJS Views

Overview:
This project is a **full-stack hotel management system** designed to manage hotel operations like **user management**, **room bookings**, and **dashboard analytics**. The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **MongoDB** for database storage and **EJS** as the templating engine for rendering dynamic web pages.
The system ensures secure, efficient, and scalable management of hotel data through APIs and middleware, while also providing a functional and interactive UI for admins.

### **Technologies Used**

1. **Programming Language:** JavaScript (Node.js environment)
2. **Backend Framework:** Express.js
3. **Frontend Templating:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
4. **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL database) with Mongoose ORM
5. **Security & Middleware:**

   * Helmet → Secure HTTP headers
   * CORS → Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
   * Morgan → HTTP request logging
   * Express-rate-limit → Prevents abuse by limiting requests
6. **Version Control:** Git/GitHub
7. **Package Manager:** npm

### **Project Structure**

* **`server.js`** → Main entry file to configure Express server, middleware, and routes.
* **`db.js`** → Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
* **`api/apiRoutes.js`** → Contains all backend API endpoints.
* **`middlewares/`**

  * `errorHandler.js` → Global error-handling middleware.
  * `logger.js` → Logs all requests for debugging and monitoring.
* **`models/`**

  * `Bookings.js` → Schema/model for booking details.
  * `user.js` → Schema/model for user authentication and details.
* **`package.json`** → Lists all dependencies and scripts.

---

### **Core Features**

1. **User Authentication & Management**

   * Register and login system for hotel admins/staff.
   * MongoDB-based user storage.
2. **Room Booking Management**

   * Create, read, update, and delete bookings.
   * Booking details stored securely in MongoDB.
3. **Dynamic Hotel Dashboard**

   * EJS-based pages that show booking stats, recent customers, etc.
   * Secure access — only after login.
4. **Security & Performance**

   * Helmet for secure headers.
   * CORS for safe cross-origin requests.
   * Rate limiting to avoid DDoS/brute force.
5. **Logging & Error Handling**

   * Morgan logs requests.
   * Centralized error handler for cleaner debugging.

### **How It Works**

1. **Server Initialization:**
   `server.js` starts the Express server, connects to MongoDB via `db.js`, and sets up middleware for security and logging.

2. **Request Handling:**
   All API requests are routed via `api/apiRoutes.js`, which communicates with the **Mongoose models** (`Bookings.js` and `user.js`) for data operations.

3. **View Rendering:**
   EJS templates render dynamic HTML pages for the hotel dashboard, displaying booking data from MongoDB.

4. **Data Flow:**
   User input → API route → Mongoose model → MongoDB → Response to frontend (EJS view or JSON).

### **Possible Future Enhancements**

* Add payment gateway integration.
* Implement role-based access control (Admin/Staff).
* Build a React or Vue frontend for a modern UI.
* Add real-time updates using WebSockets.
